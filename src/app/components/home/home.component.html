        </h1>

        <p class="text-center">
            Thank you for your interest in this year's Crawfish Cup Tennis Tournament benefitting the American Cancer Society. 
            This year's event is scheduled for <strong>April 28-30, 2017</strong> at Highland Road Tennis Center.<br /><br />

            Unlike previous years, this event is not going to be a mixed doubles tournament. Rather, the format will now consist of 
            three doubles pairs on level (team format). Please see the <a [routerLink]="'/information'">"Rules & Info"</a> page for more specific details.  <br /><br />
            
            As always we will be serving Friday night dinner, Saturday lunch, Saturday night crawfish boil, and Sunday lunch. <br /><br />

            We are looking forward to yet another great event!
        </p>
